<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5>
<p>Usually, remote databases are accessed through the internet. In this project, the database will be on your computer, but it will still be run as a separate program (we'll call it the server). The client who wants to <code class="language-java">get</code>, <code class="language-java">create</code>, or <code class="language-java">delete </code>some information is a separate program too.<br/>
<br/>
We will be using a <strong>socket </strong>to connect to the database (server). A socket is an interface to send and receive data between different processes. These processes can be on the same computer or different computers connected through the internet.</p>
<p>To connect to the server, the client must know its address, which consists of two parts: IP address and port. The local address of your computer is always "127.0.0.1". The port can be any number between 0 and 65535, but preferably greater than 1024 to avoid conflicts with well-known ports used by system processes.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this client-side code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(address), port);
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());</code></pre>
<p>The client created a new socket, which means that the client tried to connect to the server. Successful creation of a socket means that the client found the server and managed to connect to it.</p>
<p>After that, you can see the creation of <code class="language-java">DataInputStream</code> and <code class="language-java">DataOutputStream</code> objects. These are the input and output streams to the server, respectively. If you expect data from the server, you need to write <code class="language-java">input.readUTF()</code>. This returns the String object that the server sent to the client. If you want to send data to the server, you need to write <code class="language-java">output.writeUTF(stringText)</code>, and this message will be sent to the server.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the server-side code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(address));
Socket socket = server.accept();
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output  = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());</code></pre>
<p>The server created a <code class="language-java">ServerSocket</code> object that waits for client connections. When a client connects, the method <code class="language-java">server.accept()</code> returns the <code class="language-java">Socket</code> connection to this client.</p>
<p>After that, you can see the creation of <code class="language-java">DataInputStream</code> and <code class="language-java">DataOutputStream</code> objects. These are the input stream from and output stream to this client, respectively, now from the server side. To receive data from the client, write <code class="language-java">input.readUTF()</code>. To send data to the client, write <code class="language-java">output.writeUTF(stringText)</code>. The server should stop after responding to the client.</p>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will implement the simplest connection between one server and one client. The client should send the server a message: something along the lines of <code class="language-java">Give me a record # N</code>, where <code class="language-java">N</code> is an arbitrary integer number. The server should reply <code class="language-java">A record # N was sent!</code> to the client. Both the client and the server should print the received messages to the console.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this stage, we are focusing solely on establishing communication between the client and server using sockets, and printing the exchanged messages. We are not yet performing actual database operations (<code class="language-java">get</code>, <code class="language-java">set</code>, <code class="language-java">delete</code>), like we did in the previous stage.</p></div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Implement a server that waits for a client connection and responds to a specific message.</li>
<li>Implement a client that connects to the server and sends a specific message.</li>
<li>Ensure both the client and the server print the received messages to the console.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before a client connects to the server, the server output should be: <code class="language-java">Server started!</code>. Similarly, after the client connects to the server, the client should print <code class="language-java">Client started!</code>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The server and the client are different programs that run separately. Your server should run from the <code class="language-java">main</code> method of the <code class="language-java">Main</code> class in the <code class="language-java">/server</code> package, and the client should run from the <code class="language-java">main</code> method of the <code class="language-java">Main</code> class in the <code class="language-java">/client</code> package. To test your program, you should run the server first so a client can connect to the server.</p></div>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>The server should output something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Server started!
Received: Give me a record # 12
Sent: A record # 12 was sent!
</code></pre>
<p>The client should output something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Client started!
Sent: Give me a record # 12
Received: A record # 12 was sent!
</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here, number 12 in the examples was chosen arbitrarily. You can use any integer number of your liking.</p></div>
