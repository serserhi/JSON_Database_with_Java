<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5>
<p>In the previous stages, you worked with an in-memory database, where the data was stored as a JSON object using Java Collections to allow for String keys and values. While this approach is suitable for small-scale applications, it has limitations when it comes to data persistence and scalability.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, you can work with a file-based database. By storing the database as a file on the hard drive, you can ensure that the data persists even if the server is restarted. This approach also prepares you for handling larger datasets that may not fit entirely in memory.</p>
<p>When your database server becomes very popular, it wonâ€™t be able to process a large number of requests because it can only process one request at a time. To avoid that scenario, you can parallelize the server's work using executors, so that each request is parsed and handled in a separate executor's task. The main thread should just wait for incoming requests.</p>
<p>For this kind of functionality, you will additionally need <strong>synchronization</strong> because all your threads will work with the same (database) file. Even after parallelizing, you need to maintain the integrity of the database. Of course, you can't write the file in more than one separate threads simultaneously, but if no one is currently writing to the file, a lot of threads can read it, and no one can interrupt the other since no one is modifying it. This behavior is implemented in <code class="language-java">java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> class. It allows multiple readers of the resource but only a single writer. Once a writer locks the resource, it waits until all the readers finish reading and only then starts to write. The readers can freely read the file even though other readers locked it, but if the writer locks the file, no readers can read it.</p>
<p>To use this class, you need two locks: read lock and write lock. See the snippet below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();</code></pre>
<p>Every time you want to read the file, invoke <code class="language-java">readLock.lock()</code>. After reading, invoke <code class="language-java">readLock.unlock()</code>. And do the same with <code class="language-java">writeLock</code>, but only when you want to change the data.</p>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will need to improve your client and server by adding the ability to work with files. The server should store (persist) the database as a file on the hard drive, updating it only when setting a new value or deleting one. This functionality is crucial for maintaining data persistence and ensuring that the database state is saved even if the server is restarted.</p>
<p>To handle multiple requests efficiently, you will parallelize the server's work using executors. Each request will be parsed and handled in a separate executor's task, allowing the server to process multiple requests simultaneously. This improvement will significantly enhance the server's performance and scalability, making it capable of handling a higher load.</p>
<p>Implementing synchronization is essential to maintain the integrity of the database when multiple threads access the same file. By using the <code class="language-java">ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> class, you can allow multiple threads to read the file concurrently while ensuring that only one thread can write to the file at a time. This will prevent data corruption and ensure consistent access to the database.</p>
<p>Additionally, you will implement the ability for the client to read a request from a file. If the <code class="language-java">-in</code> argument is followed by a file name, the client should read the request from that file. The file will be stored in the <code class="language-java">/client/data</code> directory. This feature allows the client to directly send pre-formatted JSON requests to the server, bypassing the need to first convert command-line arguments into JSON format and then send that JSON to the server.</p>
<p>One significant advantage of this feature is that it will allow us to store not just strings but also complex JSON objects as values in the future. Writing complex JSON objects directly on the command line can be tedious and error-prone. By using pre-formatted JSON files, we can easily manage and send complex data structures to the server.</p>
<p>Here are the examples of the input file contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{"type":"set","key":"name","value":"Sorabh"}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">{"type":"get","key":"name"}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">{"type":"delete","key":"name"}</code></pre>
<p>For reading client requests from a file, you can get the path using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">path = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/src/client/data/" + fileName;</code></pre>
<p>Note that like in the previous stage, you should store the database as a JSON object. The keys and values should both be strings.</p>
<p>Example of the contents of a JSON database file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "key1": "some string value",
    "key2": "another string value",
    "key3": "yet another string value"
}</code></pre>
<p>For working with database file, you can get the path using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">path = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/src/server/data/db.json";
</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Persist the Database</strong>: The server should store the database on the hard drive in a <code class="language-java">db.json</code> file, located in the <code class="language-java">/server/data</code> folder. The database should be updated only after setting a new value or deleting an existing one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallelize Request Handling</strong>: The server should handle multiple requests simultaneously by using executors. Each request should be processed in a separate task, while the main thread waits for incoming requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement Synchronization</strong>: Ensure that multiple threads can read the database file concurrently, but only one thread can write to the file at a time. This will prevent data corruption and ensure consistent access to the database.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Read Requests from a File</strong>: The client should be able to read a request from a file if the <code class="language-java">-in</code> argument is followed by a file name. The file will be stored in the <code class="language-java">/client/data</code> directory.</p>
